#Players class needs to account for 2 players, player 1 and player 2 (instance variable)
#needed for the name and lives of each player as instance variables

#questions class (we need 2 different instance variables for numbers to add together.)
#we also need to make them a different number between 1 and 20 each time so we need
#random number method to apply to those instance variables

#game class (needed to start new instance of a game where we can define how the game will operate
#and keep score of lives for player)
